# 🔌 circuit-by-circuit

Welcome to my Arduino playground!  
This repository documents my hands-on journey of learning electronics and embedded systems — one circuit at a time.

---

## 🚀 What is this?

I'm an electronics and communication engineering student exploring Arduino and embedded systems.  
This repo is my learning log: every circuit I build, understand, and improve goes here. It’s my way of growing publicly and sharing with other learners.
